# `FOUR CORE COMPONENT OF IA`

- `Organization Schemes and Structures`: How information is categorized and structured
- `Labeling System` : How information is represented
- `Navigation System`: How users browse or move through information.
- `Search System`: How users look for information.

## `What is IA?`

IA mean consciously organizing the content and flow of a website app or system.

that organization should me meaningful which means its based on what you know about the
people using the site.

In particular what their preconceptions and expectations are.

IA then is based on:

- how content will be organized
- what content will be called (labeling)
- what and how much they expect to find
- how they expect to be able to move through it
- how they expect to be able to `view,enter,download,manipulate or interact` with it.

IA vs .site map?

the difference is this:

IA is strategy for categorizing organizing priority and linking content based on
user expectations/need and business goal

site map is visual representation that illustrates this strategy.

the site map shows site navigation and main content areas along with the relationships between pages on the site.

## `Content Strategy`

- `content should be leveraged strategically to serve a goal`. To deliver a specific message to end users to make them feel a certain way.

- To provide something they can't get `anywhere else` or at least not in this way.

- this means that the there are certain `considerations` that determine what kinds of
  content should be included on your website.

#takeAway

the content you or your client chooses has to be three things:

- Relevant. why are building the website or the system? who we are building for?
- appropriate. are you telling the truth? what are giving to the user?
- useful. is content useful? #don't_do_happy_talk
  - what's in it for me?
  - is it all about me or about them?

## `identifying content requirements`

#question_to_ask_about_content and #Don't_have_open_assumption

- who's going to create content?
- who's going to edit and approve it?
- who's going to manage and update it?
- what are competitor doing?
- will people think this is `useful` and `valuable`?
- how will they find all of this content?
- how many different kinds of content are there?
  - audio?
  - video?
- where does this fit in our established IA?
- how will we display this? animation?
- Are there `from factor` restriction? what different content to show on different screen size or which content we should omit on different screen?

## `Identifying content workflows`

1. `talk to content stakeholders.`

identify everyone and anyone associated with creating editing approval or requesting
content

- `you ask question they answer`: you diagram and ask additional question as the conversation takes place.

- ask them to describe their `current process` for `creating` and publishing content

- ask them what's `working` and what isn't

- ask them which people in what role are involved in content `creating` , `editing` and `approval`

2. `Define tasks and activities` what people want from it ??

- adding text phots, video , twitter , feeds form , etc. do they need this?
- creating new pages
- deleting pages and digital assets
- adding or updating metadata
- publishing content to a test server
- returning new or edited content with comments for revision
- `how much control do they need?`

3. diagram the process.

4. ask question as you diagram.

- how do we manage workflow when multiple author are working on the same page?
- socialize

`Physical`

- how people will be using your website or system??

`Environmental`

- what is room is like ??

`Preferential`

- do the prefer to access the content?
- on what device?
- what they prefer video or audio?
- are there learning disabilities or physical disabilities that should be considered?

`Emotional`

- how is the person feeling? what's their stress level?
- what motivating their activity their use of the website

`Cognitive`

- what assumptions will they make based on what they read and interact with?

## `Creating + Prioritizing IA`

- file naming & taxonomy
- content labeling & taxonomy
- `taxonomy means classification`

Content labeling

- clear descriptive words and phrases
- ## `strive for simplicity accuracy and clarity while labeling`
- don't overlap categories
- make sure your organizational scheme make sense to user `eg. No model number or sportan`.
- ## `Don't rely on your own opinions.`

## `file naming`

![fileNameExample]('../fileNameExample.png')

- naming
- modeling
- ## `File name should match IA category labels`
-
